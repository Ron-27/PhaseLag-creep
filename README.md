# Extracting Phase Lag Between Complex Time Series

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains Julia code for extracting phase lag between signals that have underlying trends.
The provided Pluto notebooks also show how to reproduce the figures from the article.

## How to Use

Fork the repo and run the notebooks.

The notebook `attenuation_signals.jl` shows how to reproduce the figures using the raw data from the attenuation experiments

The notebook `synthetic_signals.jl` shows how to extract phase lags from artificial signals and reproduce the figures represented in the article.
